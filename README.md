# oresat-star-tracker

This is the repository for all things related to the star tracker system for OreSat. 

We intend to base our star tracking system on [OpenStarTracker, from the University of Buffalo](http://openstartracker.org "OpenStarTracker, from the University of Buffalo").

Below is an explanation of each directory:

- STM32F4-camera-system - OreSat camera system based on the STM32F4 MCU
- archive - old files and projects no longer in use
- camera_testing - files related to testing our AR0130-based cameras
- img-processor - directory for the image preprocessor, used in conjunction with OpenStarTracker
- openstartracker - star tracker software, based on OpenStarTracker from Univ. of Buffalo
- oresat-camera-hardware - directories related to hardware for OreSat camera system
