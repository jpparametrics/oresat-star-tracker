Tetra Optimization Flow

ST = Star Tracker
OS = Oresat

Prediction Mode: OS has not used ST in a while but thinks it knows where it is looking
    - ADACS continuously sends predicted RA/DEC to ST
        > ST finds the narrowest Star Catalogue encompassing those coordinates and loads that catalogue into cache
    - ADACS requests attitude from star tracker
        > ST runs Tetra with currently cached catalog.
        > If search succeeds, send back coordinates with time stamp.

    
Continuous Mode: OS has been STing and has a very good idea where it is looking

Lost in Space Mode: OS has no idea where it is looking. This is default if all other modes fail to find a match

Decoder: needs to generate multiple star catalogs of different fields of view

Testing: need multiple images covering all parts of the sky to ensure it works. 

Notes:
  - The overlap between the cached catalogs should be > half the field of view
