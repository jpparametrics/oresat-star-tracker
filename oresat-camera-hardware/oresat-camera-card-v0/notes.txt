- boot pin jumpers
- USB gadget
- select between onboard power supply, pin header supply, and USB supply(from gadget?)
- SD card and eMMC
- status(heart beat) LEDs?
- Hmmmmm, camera I2C address translation?
- USB A female port(s)
- UART broken out
- bus termination resistors
- ERM8-013-01-L-D-EM2-TR
- CAUTION!!! I2C0 has internal pulp resistors, per Table 11, footnote 1 https://octavosystems.com/app_notes/osd335x-schematic-checklist-am335x/
- need to program EEPROM with board ID for u-boot: https://octavosystems.com/app_notes/osd335x-design-tutorial/osd335x-lesson-2-minimal-linux-boot/osd335x-lesson-2-linux-bring-up/
- U-boot will not boot without a valid board ID. What if that EEPROM getâ€™s corrupted in space?
- any pru inputs to measure exposure time?
