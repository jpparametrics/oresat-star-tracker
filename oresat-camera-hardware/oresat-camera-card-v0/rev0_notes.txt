- C8 0805 22uF should be 1210 
- see power plane on balls H10 and H11
- C4 0805 10uF should be 0603 like all others on board, unless there is a compelling reason why not
- re-number refers, though this might make the second rev confusing
- it'd be nice if C18, instead of 2.2uF, could be 1uF, or use 2 1uF, 
- rename JTAG header CM1 to Jx
- all parts should have correct MPN as attribute
- D1 should user amber LED part, not green
- 10uF 0603 should be 0805
- in attributes, note part numbers for different temperature grades for ICs, like CLVCH16T245MDGGREP vs 74LVCH16T245DGGRE4
- swap tx and rx on UART header
- fix resistor on MIC842
- separate C38 and C37
- fake label text bigger
- RC circuit on camera reset, see AR0130 datasheet, pg. 14
- perhaps optional pullups on camera control lines
- usb lines too close to C37
- this USB ribbon cable is giving me issues, maybe use other type of connector
- R12 was accidentally deleted(no cream)R39 label on silk
- c17 label on silk
- breakout I2C0 !!
- TPs on reset circuit
- make font bigger(use minimum oshpark size)
- labeled TPs would be nice
- would be nice if SD was closer to edge
- breakout I2C2 (maybe I2C1 as well)
- pullups/downs on all camera lines, with control buffer disabled, so that comes up and stays in good state until initialized
- fix MIC842 footprint
