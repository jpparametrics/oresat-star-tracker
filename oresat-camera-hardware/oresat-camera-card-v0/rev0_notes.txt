- C8 0805 22uF should be 1210 
- see power plane on balls H10 and H11
- C4 0805 10uF should be 0603 like all others on board, unless there is a compelling reason why not
- re-number refers, though this might make the second rev confusing
- it'd be nice if C18, instead of 2.2uF, could be 1uF, or use 2 1uF, 
- rename JTAG header CM1 to Jx
- all parts should have correct MPN as attribute
- D1 should user amber LED part, not green
- 10uF 0603 should be 0805
- in attributes, note part numbers for different temperature grades for ICs, like CLVCH16T245MDGGREP vs 74LVCH16T245DGGRE4
- swap tx and rx on UART header
- fix resistor on MIC842
- separate C38 and C37
- fake label text bigger
