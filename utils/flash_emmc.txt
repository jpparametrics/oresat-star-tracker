#### Make eMMC Bootable ####
############################

# the eMMC is now flashed, but we still have a few steps before it will boot Debian.
# recall before when we have to add the dtbo to /lib/firmware and modify the uEnv.txt
# file in order to enable the eMMC. Well, if we tried to boot the eMMC right now, it 
# would boot into uBoot, but would not boot Debian because uBoot would not enable the
# eMMC for linux and thus there would be not roots. So, we need to add that device tree
# to the system on the eMMC and tell it to use it.

# mount the eMMC
$ sudo mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 /mnt

# copy the dtbo onto the eMMC system
$ cp /lib/firmware/BB-BONE-eMMC1-01-00A0.dtbo /mnt/lib/firmware/BB-BONE-eMMC1-01-00A0.dtbo

# add the below line to the eMMC system uEnv.txt file (/mnt/boot/uEnv.txt)
uboot_overlay_addr4=/lib/firmware/BB-BONE-eMMC1-01-00A0.dtbo

# unmount the eMMC
$ sudo umount /mnt

# shutdown
$ sudo shutdown -h now

# unplug the micro SD card
# switch the sys boot jumpers to boot from the eMMC(mmc1)
# to boot from the SD card, the should be sysboot[4:0] == 0b11000
# to boot from the eMMC, they should be sysboot[4:0] == 0b11100

# cycle power and it should boot into Debian on the eMMC
